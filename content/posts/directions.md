### Venue Address
8500 127th St E, Hastings, MN 55033

### Hotel Address
Listed once we have chosen a hotel

### In-Area Guests
I-94 & I-35 come right into the heart of the Twin Cities and will get you very close to the venue & hotel. 

We hope to have a shuttle secured shortly after choosing the hotel, updates on this will follow soon. If you are interested in driving yourself to the venue, it is off highway 55 as you head out of town. For directions from the city, please refer to your chosen technology or see the [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Minneapolis,+Minnesota/Spring+Lake+Park+Reserve+Schaar's+Bluff+Trail,+8500+127th+St+E,+Hastings,+MN+55033/@44.8171795,-93.17371,11.26z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x52b333909377bbbd:0x939fc9842f7aee07!2m2!1d-93.2650108!2d44.977753!1m5!1m1!1s0x87f7c5889f09eeff:0x81e9cc3d7b5459c7!2m2!1d-92.933928!2d44.7660229!3e0).

Once we decide on a hotel, the specific directions will be listed here.

### Out-of-Area Guests

If traveling from out of the area, the Minneapolis-St Paul airport is a perfect option. The hotel we choose will have a free shuttle to/from the airport and we're hoping to run one to/from the venue as well so no need to rent a car, unless you'd like to. 

If you have any questions regarding travel, shuttles, or other direction related questions, give us a call!
