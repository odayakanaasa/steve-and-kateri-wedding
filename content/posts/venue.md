The venue will be host to both the ceremony and reception so settle in & enjoy!

 * The ceremony will be outside in the notoriously comfortable Minnesota July season - beautiful days, beautiful nights.

 * The venue takes place just steps from the outdoor ceremony in the Gathering Center itself. We're still testing caterers but as soon as we select the dishes, we'll put some teasers up here on the website.

The Gathering Center is part of the Spring Lake Park Reserve outside of Hastings, MN which is about 30 minutes SE of where we live in Minneapolis. The Star Tribune newspaper put it best [when they said](http://www.startribune.com/in-hastings-minn-history-and-natural-beauty/225407192/), "Spring Lake Park Reserve, also known as Schaar’s Bluff, is a hidden gem in this Upper Mississippi River Valley area. Don’t let the cornfields fool you as you drive to this Dakota County park. The landscape changes quickly from farmland to bluff country. And once you hit the trails, the views are spectacular. This part overlooks the Mississippi. Its trails include the Schaar’s Bluff Trailhead, where views stretch to the Twin Cities. Locals say it’s the premier place to catch a sunset."

They couldn't be more right! The park & venue is perched over the Mississippi river offering an expansive view of one of the countries greatest waterways. The aforementioned 4.3 miles of walking trail w/ ["incredible landscape views"](https://www.twincities.com/2017/05/19/dakota-countys-new-4-3-mile-river-trail-offers-scenic-views-incredible-landscape/) will be a welcomed surprise to anyone looking for a quiet retreat after dinner and a few drinks. The area also has a playground, and is a playground in itself, for all the kids. (or take them on the trails!)

In addition to the kids running around in this vast area, we also plan to have some ladder golf, bags, other party games setup. Have ideas? Call/text/email us! Someone bring a frisbee! You're encouraged to bring whatever games you enjoy on a summers day out. 

Once the day turns into night, there in a cozy firepit w/ seating right outside the main room where we can gather to roast smores & recap the festivities. There is some hidden audial delights going on in this area thanks to the clever architecture, but we'll leave that for you to discover!

Well, you made it this far so you must be as interested in The Gathering Center as we are. Here's some cool tidbits about it.

* On most days, the building runs completely on wind power produced just a stones throw from the building itself. It also sports a roof that collects rainwater to be used within the building. 

* More in a few minutes
