We were able to secure a block of rooms at the Hampton Inn Minneapolis/Eagan. The rate per night is $109 plus tax and can be reserved by either calling and mentioning the Frost wedding or by reserving at the link below. If you're able to find a better rate online using a different website or a coupon code feel free to go that route, but please let us know so we can assign you to our block.

If you'd like other options, there's a ton of other hotels in the nearby area. Please note that the wedding shuttle likely won't be able to stop at these but you could take it to from the wedding to Eagan and then get a Lyft or Uber from there.

* Sonesta ES Suites (across the street from the Hampton)
* Extended Stay America (across the highway from the Hampton and one about 1.5 miles away)
* Holiday Inn (about 1.5 miles)
* Best Western (about 2 miles)
* Hilton Garden Inn (5.5 miles)
* Quality Inn & Suites (5.5 miles)

The Hampton Inn has free breakfast, pool, hot tub, free parking, free wireless internet, AND most importantly, a free shuttle to/from the MSP airport, Mall of America, and Twin Cities Premium Outlets from 4am-11pm. With that being said, if you're flying in, you won't need to rent a car unless you'd really like to as we'll also have a shuttle to/from the wedding + there's Lyft/Uber available in the area.

There's a *ton* of shopping, dining, and activities in this area. For shopping there's the Mall of America (has a rollercoaster!) and the Twin Cities Premium Outlets - both of which can be reached by the shuttle. If you prefer the outdoors, Lebanon Hills Regional Park is 5-7 miles (depending on where you enter) South of the hotel which houses a zoo, tons of hiking/biking trails and a golf course.

And for eating/drinking there's options steps from the hotel!
