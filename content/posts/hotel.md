The hotel info will be released soon though it's likely we'll choose somewhere in Eagen which is perfectly situated halfway between the Minneapolis-St Paul Airport & The Gathering Center. There is also plenty of shopping, a few different golf courses, a brewery (maybe more than one but for sure one), and a plethora of restaurants. We're shooting to have a entire block of the hotel reserved for the wedding guests to extend the fun multiple nights.

If you would like to reserve a hotel on your own, anywhere around Eagen or Hastings is a good option. There are also a few beautiful bed and breakfast places in the area as well as available camping just 15 minutes from the venue.
