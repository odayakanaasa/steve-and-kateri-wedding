The candidates for hotels will be released soon on the [Hotel](https://steveandkateri.com/hotel) page though it's likely we'll choose somewhere in Eagen which is perfectly situated halfway between the Minneapolis-St Paul Airport & The Gathering Center. There is also plenty of shopping, a few different golf courses, a brewery (maybe more than one but for sure one), and a plethora of restaurants.
