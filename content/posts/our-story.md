Just over 9 years ago, Kateri was sitting around her apartment wondering what to do for the evening while Steve was busy planning that night's house party. Kateri's best friend Bri convinced her to go to a friend of a friend's house party. Thinking that she'd only make an appearance and leave shortly after, she decided to go. In she walked and the first person she made eye contact with was none other than Steve. He was wearing his classic college pocket tee, jeans and some sharp Nike 9.0s. Needless to say, Kateri didn't leave early.

We started dating shortly after that night and the rest has really been history. We got Enzo not long after dating and then stole Kidden a year or so later. Then, once Steve graduated, he moved out to NYC for a job and Kateri followed soon after and finished up school out on the East coast. It was a really big culture shock at first but we were really able to learn who we were individually and as a couple out there. We started exploring as much of the city as we could by walking and riding our bikes. We made great friendships and ate a *ton* of great food. We saw tons of concerts and visited so many interesting places. We became plant-based and much more environmentally conscious. Steve ran his first half marathon and we both rode our first, and probably our last, century with two of our close friends. We got _engaged_! Though intimated at first, our stint in NYC enabled a unique experience for us both. Though our love for NYC was strong, we made a conscious decision to move back to the Midwest to be closer to our family, reclaim a true 4-season life, and be part of a region & city more in line with our passions.

So after moving halfway across the country 2 years after we started dating, we moved an even further distance back to the midwest 7 years later. And we're continuing to do all the things we did in NYC - experience everything we possibly can in Minneapolis. We've seen more concerts in 6 months than we did in the past 6 years, have settled into a record amount of community organizations, and are excited to conintue to explore the city. We're still continuing to grow, learn from each other, and love each other the best way we can.

And now, almost a decade later, we're tying the knot.

Can't wait to see everyone soon and share our big day with you!
